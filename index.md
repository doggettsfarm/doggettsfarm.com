## Coronavirus update

{:.govuk-body}
We understand that the footpath along Doggetts Chase is really important to a lot of people in Rochford keeping mentally and physically fit, especially when we're under lock down.

{:.govuk-body}
Please help keep everyone healthy by making sure that you:

{:.govuk-list .govuk-list--bullet}
* keep 2 metres away from others - especially those working
* don't gather in groups
* keep to the road or on the verge
* pick up your litter and dog mess as usual

{:.govuk-body}
Keep each other safe and well by [following the government guidance](https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus).

## Visiting the farm

We work hard to keep our countryside beautiful, and would appreciate your help too.

A footpath runs down the length of [Doggetts Chase](https://goo.gl/maps/uPhC6CQuBXt6qDrZ8). Please be careful when walking down the road as it is in constant use by farm machinery.

{:.govuk-body}
Follow [the Countryside Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Country_Code):

{:.govuk-list .govuk-list--bullet}
* keep dogs under close control
* pick up after yourselves
* keep to the footpath

{:.govuk-body}
Make sure you say hello to the horses and alpacas on the way through. Some of them are getting on a little bit now and are on special diets to keep them fit and well. Please do your part by not giving them treats - vet bills are expensive!
